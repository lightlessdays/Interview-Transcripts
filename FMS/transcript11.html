        <h2>Group Discussion (GD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> "Simplicity is the sole reason for success" (paraphrased)</p>
        <p>GD was a crucial part of the selection process as the same panelists evaluated both GD and PI. There were 8 participants with a total of 9 minutes to discuss.</p>
        <p>I began the GD, spoke for more than a minute, provided contrasts with examples, and contributed 3-4 more times. I argued that while simplicity is important, it cannot be the sole reason for success. I also cited the example of <strong>Mr. Manohar Parrikar</strong>. Overall, I felt I performed well.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interview (PI)</h2>
        <p><strong>Panelists:</strong> Two female professors (F1 & F2).</p>

        <p class="question">Me: Good morning, ma’am.</p>
        <p class="answer">F1: Good morning.</p>

        <p class="question">Me: May I? (Pointing to the chair)</p>
        <p class="answer">F1: Yes, please.</p>

        <p class="question">F1: So, X, you’re still studying, is it?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Yes, ma’am.</p>

        <p class="question">F1: You’re studying in an NIT?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Yes, ma’am. I’m in my final year pursuing Mechanical Engineering from NITK Surathkal.</p>

        <p class="question">F1: What have you done in college?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Told.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Tell us about the social initiative you’ve mentioned in your form.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Told.*</p>

        <h2>Extempore</h2>
        <p class="question">F1: Okay, we’ll now give you a topic. You have to speak on it for 1 minute. Your topic is **CRY**.</p>

        <p>I assumed it referred to emotional crying and began talking about how people cry in happiness and sadness. I mentioned a mother’s happiness when her baby cries for the first time.</p>

        <p class="question">F1 (interrupting): Do you even know what your topic is? It’s the foundation **CRY**.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Oh… (Realized my mistake).*</p>

        <p>Both panelists chuckled.</p>

        <p class="question">Me: Should I restart?</p>
        <p class="answer">F1: Yes, start again.</p>

        <p>I had no idea about the CRY foundation but spoke a few generic lines.</p>

        <p class="question">F1 (interrupting again): Do you know what CRY does?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me (sheepishly): No, ma'am.</p>

        <p class="question">F1: No problem. Know of any other organization?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Didn’t know much, so I said PETA.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Okay, so **PETA** is your topic.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Spoke about PETA for 40-45 seconds but struggled for content.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: You still have time.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Said something irrelevant.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Okay, stop. Do you follow news?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Yes, ma’am.</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Tell me some recent news.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Mentioned elections.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: No, not elections. Something else.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Jet Airways crisis.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Anything else?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Tata Motors share price drop.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Why did the price fall?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Explained well.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: What did they do to overcome this?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Didn’t know but still attempted an answer.*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Who taught you all these fancy terms?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me (smiling): Ma’am, the main aim of any business is profit maximization. (Blunder!)</p>

        <p class="question">F1: No, no, no. It's not to make profits.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Tried to correct—"Sorry ma’am, it’s to maximize wealth."*</p>

        <p class="question">F1: Yes. You should read an article (forgot the name).</p>

        <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
        <p class="question">F1: What’s the meaning of your name?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Harsh means "happiness" and Pra means "extra," so X means "extra happiness."</p>
