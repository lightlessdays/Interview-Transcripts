        <h2>Academic Performance</h2>

        <h2>Family & Business Questions</h2>

        <p class="question">**M1:** Why not ABC? You have a good percentile.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Likely because of my low 12th percentage.*</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** So, FMS is your best call?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Yes sir, my preparation was always aimed at converting FMS.*</p>

        <h2>Reservation Discussion</h2>
