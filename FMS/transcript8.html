        <h2>Interview Questions & Responses</h2>

        <p class="question">**L2:** X, you're a Computer Engineer. Do you think we have too many Computer Engineers in India?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *No ma’am, we are a developing country and need engineers for IT infrastructure. Quoted John Adams’ philosophy on learning stages.*</p>

        <p class="question">**L2:** Okay. Draw a graph to represent what you just said.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Confused but tried to mask it. Asked for axis details. Plotted investment in education vs. growth.*</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** Shouldn’t your graph be an inverted U-shape? You start with Liberal Arts, move to Engineering, then return to Liberal Arts.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Oh, in that way, yes, it can be.*</p>

        <h3>Extempore</h3>
        <p class="question">**L1:** Your extempore topic is "Folder."</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Started with its functional use, then discussed digital alternatives (cloud storage), and metaphorical meanings of "fold" (grouping and giving in under pressure).*</p>

        <h2>Technical & Business Questions</h2>

        <p class="question">**M1:** Do you know about supercomputers?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Explained supercomputers as high-powered machines used for number crunching, weather forecasting, and scientific calculations.*</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** What’s a "lot" of processing power?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Defined it qualitatively but admitted lack of precise knowledge.*</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** What comes after TBs?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *TB stands for Terabyte. I do not know what comes after that.*</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** How many processors make a supercomputer?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Guessed 7-8 (incorrect, later found out world’s most powerful supercomputer has ~41,000 processors).*</p>

        <h2>Personal & Behavioral Questions</h2>

        <p class="question">**L2:** You have an accent when you speak. How did you acquire it?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Grew up watching too many Hollywood movies, might have subconsciously picked it up. Nonchalantly added that I don’t think much about it.*</p>

        <p class="question">**L2:** Has anyone ever pointed it out?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Yes, friends and colleagues have mentioned it.*</p>

        <p class="question">**L2:** Any converts so far?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *No ma’am. I have calls from new IIMs, but results are not out yet.*</p>

        <p class="question">**L2:** So no converts yet?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Yes ma’am. No converts yet.*</p>

        <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
        <p class="question">Interviewers looked at each other and signaled the end of the interview.</p>

        <p class="question">**M1:** When you go out, read up about supercomputers.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *With a wide smile—Yes sir, I certainly do intend to do so.*</p>

        <h2>Verdict: <span style="color: red;">Not Converted</span></h2>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p class="answer">Kept a smile throughout the interview, even when put on the spot. Supercomputer grilling was unexpected but a learning experience.</p>
