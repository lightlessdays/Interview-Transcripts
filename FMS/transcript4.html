        <h2>Group Discussion</h2>
        <p class="question">**Topic:** Knowledge-based Economy is Necessary for the Economic Development of India.</p>
        <p class="answer">There were 7 people in the group. The discussion was cordial and not a fish market. Since the topic was easy, everyone contributed. I initiated the discussion, explaining the historical significance of knowledge-based economies and India's necessity to develop into one in the 21st century. Later, I discussed India's advantages and the challenges it might face in achieving this goal. Overall, it was a productive discussion.</p>

        <p class="question">**Topic:** Whatâ€™s in a Name?</p>
        <p class="answer">Started with William Shakespeareâ€™s famous quote and its context. Related it to India, discussing how a personâ€™s name often reflects social issues like the caste system. Concluded by linking the quote to the IPL Season 12 promotion campaign - #GameBanayegaName.</p>

        <p class="question">M1: Why did the lock industry set up in Aligarh?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *I researched this after failing to answer in my IIFT interview.

        <p class="question">M2: Are you nervous here?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *A little bit, sir. But I guess thatâ€™s natural.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Why?</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Thatâ€™s a hobby! You need to waste them.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Travel and explore.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Thatâ€™s again a hobby! Suppose you were called on a date at Cyber Hub, and the girl didnâ€™t show up. What would you do?</p>
