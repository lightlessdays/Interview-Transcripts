        <h2>Interview Transcript</h2>
        
        <p class="question">M: Good morning, Karthik.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Good morning, sir.</p>

        <p class="question">M: Start with where you did your graduation? Where are you working? Why MBA and why FMS?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *All in a go, sir?*</p>

        <p class="question">M: Yes, don't you know we have marks for your SOP?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Yes sir, I will start.*</p>
        <p class="answer">*Gave a brief answer touching all the questions.*</p>

        <h2>Extempore</h2>
        <p class="question">F: Okay Karthik, let's move on to the extempore. Your topic is ‚ÄúBuild to Last.‚Äù</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Started jotting down points on paper.*</p>

        <p class="question">F: You are not allowed to write anything. Look at the camera, think for 20 seconds, and speak for a minute.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Okay, ma'am. The things that came to my mind were startups and infrastructure. Discussed startup failures due to inexperienced founders, poor capital allocation, rapid expansion, and non-core diversification. Also briefly touched upon infrastructure.*</p>

        <p class="question">F: Your time is up. Have you read the book ‚ÄúBuild to Last‚Äù?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: No, ma'am.</p>

        <h2>Technical & Business Questions</h2>
        
        <p class="question">M: When did you start working?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *July 2019, sir.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: What are the revenue streams for Adobe?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Adobe has three revenue streams: Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: How does Adobe compete with free PDF tools available in the market?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Adobe offers a full suite of tools, not just individual features. Free sites often require credit card details after limited usage, making them cumbersome. Adobe focuses on enterprise clients, not retail customers.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: Who are Adobe‚Äôs enterprise clients?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Mostly government organizations moving towards paperless governance.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: How sustainable are Adobe‚Äôs revenues?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Adobe follows a SaaS (Software as a Service) model, ensuring recurring revenue.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: What is Experience Cloud?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *A comprehensive product for companies to manage marketing campaigns, including analytics, targeting mechanisms, and social media campaign management.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: How does Adobe compete with giants like Google and Facebook?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Adobe‚Äôs main competitor is Salesforce. Adobe has an Open Data Initiative with Microsoft and SAP for better data insights.*</p>

        <p class="question">M: How would you propose increasing Adobe‚Äôs revenue?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Adobe dominates the Document Cloud space, so growth opportunities lie in the Marketing Cloud segment, where they currently have a smaller market share.*</p>

        <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
        <p class="question">F: Nice talking to you, Karthik. We could have continued, but we need to move to the next candidate. This is your interview.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Thank you, ma‚Äôam.*</p>

        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>FMS gives marks for SOP, extempore, and GD (canceled this year). The core interview carries fewer marks compared to IIMs.</p>
