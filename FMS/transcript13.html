        <h2>Personal Interview (PI)</h2>
        <p><strong>Panelists:</strong> P1, P2 (Female), P3 (Male) (P3 left the room and did not return).</p>

        <p class="question">Me: Good morning.</p>
        <p class="answer">P2: Good morning. Please have a seat.</p>

        <p class="question">P2 (Reviewing my documents): So you were born in Ahmedabad, studied Petroleum Engineering at PDPU Gandhinagar, and currently work as a Plant Engineer at GSFC?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Yes, ma'am. Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals is a fertilizer and chemical company.</p>

        <p class="question">P2: Is it a state PSU?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: No, it is a private company promoted by the Gujarat government. (Started explaining how heavy regulation affects its status, but was interrupted.)</p>

        <p class="question">P2: We’ll get to that soon in your extempore.</p>

        <h2>Extempore</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> "Subsidy in the Fertilizer Sector"</p>
        <p>Since I had recently read about this in the Economic Survey (2015-16), I tried to recall key points. However, my structure was poor, and my flow was chaotic. I jumped between points, forgetting key details.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially talked about the current cost-based subsidy system for **urea**, but then jumped to explaining **NPK-based methods**.</li>
            <li>Realized I should cover all fertilizers, not just urea, so I started mentioning **DAP and MOP**, but time ran out before I could conclude.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, **2/5 performance at best.**</p>

        <h2>Interview Questions</h2>

        <p class="question">P2: What is the status of food security in India?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: Talked about public food stockholding, **PDS system**, India's stand at WTO, leakages, and the role of middlemen.</p>

        <p class="question">P2: As a policymaker, what steps would you take?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *(Blank for a moment—interview was going south fast.)*</p>

        <p class="question">P2 (Nudging me): You mentioned leakages, right? How would you curb them?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Mentioned middleman elimination, financial inclusion, and rural penetration but forgot to mention the **JAM agenda.***</p>

        <p class="question">P2 to P1: Do you want to ask anything?</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>

        <p class="question">P1: So, X, what do you do in your free time?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Books, Comics, and Games.*</p>

        <p class="question">P1: Which games?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Chess and Civilization (Civ 4, Civ 5).*</p>

        <p class="question">P1: You mentioned reading books. Which books?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *(Finally! A topic I was confident in.)*</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fantasy Books:</strong> Harry Potter, Mistborn, Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive, Elantris, Eragon, Warbreaker, ASOIAF series.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiction:</strong> All books by Sidney Sheldon, Kane and Abel (Jeffrey Archer), some books by Agatha Christie.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-fiction:</strong> Return of Depression Economics (Paul Krugman), I.O.U (John Lanchester), currently reading **Thinking, Fast and Slow** (Daniel Kahneman).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">P1: Ok, you can go.</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *(Disappointed at the lack of follow-up.)* I bid them farewell and left.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Interview duration: **5-7 minutes** (including extempore). Due to short interview length, the focus was on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinking on your feet.</li>
            <li>Confidence and body language.</li>
            <li>Structure of responses rather than depth of content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Verdict: <span style="color: orange;">Waitlisted at 117.</span></h2>
