        <p class="answer">I: *Excited! Spoke about how "Namaste" is closely associated with me since it's the meaning of my name. Mentioned that it's the first word foreigners learn when they visit India, that itâ€™s used to greet and show respect, and that it is synonymous with "hello." Thatâ€™s all I could think of.*</p>

        <p class="question">P3 (with a humorous remark): "Kisi ko bhagana ho toh bhi bolo Namaste!"</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Everyone laughed!*</p>

        <p class="question">P1: How long have they been working in their respective organizations?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *I donâ€™t know, maâ€™am.*</p>

        <h2>Career & Business Discussions</h2>

        <p class="answer">I: *Told.*</p>

        <p class="question">P3: How do you judge a companyâ€™s performance?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Talked about financial statementsâ€”mainly the income statement and balance sheetâ€”and what data they present.*</p>

        <p class="question">P3: Do you know any financial ratios?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Sir, I donâ€™t have much knowledge of financeâ€¦* (Suddenly remembered) *PE Ratio, sir! Price-to-earnings ratio.* *Phew!*</p>

        <p class="question">P3: Why?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Didnâ€™t answer a couple of questions well, and CAT score weightage is lower there.*</p>

        <p class="question">P3: And here youâ€™ll get the benefit of weightage.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Yes sir!*</p>
