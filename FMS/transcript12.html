        <h2>Group Discussion (GD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> "Knowledge-based economy is necessary for the economic development of India."</p>
        <p>There were 7 participants. The discussion was cordial, with no fish market situation. Since the topic was straightforward, everyone contributed well.</p>
        <p>I initiated the GD, explaining the historical significance of knowledge-based economies and why India needs to transition into one. Later, I discussed Indiaâ€™s advantages and challenges in achieving this goal. Overall, it was a productive discussion.</p>

        <h2>Extempore</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> "Whatâ€™s in a name?"</p>
        <p>Started with **William Shakespeare** and his famous quote. Then, I connected it to the Indian contextâ€”how names reflect social identities, especially caste, in India. Concluded with a reference to IPL Season 12's tagline: **#GameBanayegaName.**</p>

        <h2>Personal Interview (PI)</h2>

        <p class="question">M1: Why did the lock industry develop in Aligarh?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Researched this after being asked in my IIFT interview. Explained the historyâ€”how the British set up a mail carriage manufacturing workshop in 1852, leading to skilled labor concentration and eventual industry growth. Today, it's a â‚¹4000 crore industry.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Are you nervous here?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *A little, sir. But I guess itâ€™s natural.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Why?</p>

        <p class="answer">Me: *Iâ€™d travel and explore.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2: Still a hobby. Suppose a girl calls you on a date at Cyber Hub but doesnâ€™t show up. What do you do?</p>
        <p class="answer">Me: *Have a good dinner by myself and explore Cyber Hub.*</p>

        <p class="question">M2 (frustrated): Why are you so boring?! Waste time properly!</p>
