        <h1>FMS Delhi Interview Experience</h1>
        <h2>Candidate Profile</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Interview Date</th>
                <td>16th April 2019</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Venue</th>
                <td>FMS Delhi</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Group Discussion</h2>
        <p class="question">**Topic:** Can India Dream to Host the Olympics?</p>
        <p class="answer">There were 8 candidates in the panel, but only 3â€“4 of us spoke for the whole duration. I discussed infrastructure and its maintenance, Commonwealth Games, developing a competitive team, influx of visitors, promoting a sporting culture, and focusing on initiatives like Khelo India. Spoke for around 4 minutes out of 9, while ensuring a healthy discussion without making it a fish market.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interview</h2>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Panel Members</th>
                <td>3 Members: P1 (Female), P2 (Male), P3 (Male)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p class="question">P3 walks out of the room as soon as I enter.</p>

        <p class="question">P2: Moinack, tell us about yourself.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Told my well-prepared answer but added some spontaneous details.*</p>

        <p class="question">P1: Both your parents are hotel management graduates, so you must be having a lot of exotic food at home.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Smiled and said yes, also mentioned that I am a bit of a chef myself.*</p>

        <h2>Extempore</h2>

        <p class="question">P1: Your extempore topic is "My Favorite Dish."</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Thanked God for this, as my friends got topics like "Core" and "Marketing Techniques in Elections."*  
        Comfortably spoke about my favorite dish, how it's made, and the special ingredient (poppy seeds). Was stopped after one minute.</p>

        <p class="question">P3 enters the room now.</p>

        <p class="question">P2: Isn't poppy seed made from a drug? Are there any side effects?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Explained that industrially processed ones have no such side effects, but consuming unprocessed ones directly from fields can cause hallucinations or extended sleep.*</p>

        <h2>Finance & Business Discussion</h2>

        <p class="question">P2: Why the shift to finance? What was the starting point?</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Talked about my association with a finance professor at VIT Vellore. Mentioned that we had five compulsory management subjects, and how Benjamin Graham and stock investing influenced me.*</p>

        <p class="question">P2: Tell me the 3 most important financial ratios according to you.</p>
        <p class="answer">I:  
        1. **Return on Equity (ROE) and the 5-step DuPont Analysis**  
        2. **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** â€“ To check a companyâ€™s solvency.  
        3. **Defensive Interval Ratio** â€“ Useful for the leather goods sector, which I was analyzing at that time.</p>

        <h2>Closing & Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p class="question">P2: Okay, Moinack, we are done.</p>
        <p class="answer">I: *Shocked! The interview lasted only 6 minutes, while others had 10â€“13-minute PIs. P3 didn't ask me a single question, even though he questioned others.*</p>

        <p class="question">I was about to leave when P1 asked me about my calls and results. Told them, thanked them, and left.</p>
