        <h2>Extempore</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> "City of Chaos"</p>
        <p>Initially baffled by the topic. Connected it to my first visit to Delhiâ€”how it differs from my hometown, how people are always on the go. Recalled a scenario from the metro that morning: a group of teenagers creating chaos, while another group sat quietly, lost in their own thoughts. Thankfully, my minute was up quickly.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interview (PI)</h2>

        <p class="question">F: We see youâ€™ve been a basketball player for quite a while. Is there an NBA in India?</p>
        <p class="answer">Told.</p>

        <p class="question">F: What is Indiaâ€™s ranking in world basketball?</p>
        <p class="answer">Told (Could have mentioned separate rankings for men and women but gave a generalized answer).</p>

        <p class="question">F: Prachi, what have you been doing since 2021?</p>
        <p class="answer">Graduated in July 2021, decided to prepare for CAT properly. Simultaneously, continued basketball practice and gave tuitions.</p>

        <h2>United Nations Discussion</h2>

        <p class="question">F: You do a lot of MUNs. State in bullet points the relevance of the UN today.</p>
        <p class="answer">Explained how the UN was created to prevent wars, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war highlights its limitations. Economic sanctions help, but protecting civilians should be the priority.</p>

        <p class="question">N: Why do you say so? Hasnâ€™t the UN done anything?</p>
        <p class="answer">Mentioned meetings held at UNGA and UNSC but explained how Russiaâ€™s permanent membership and veto power hinder resolution efforts.</p>

        <p class="question">N: What can the UN do to improve the situation on the ground?</p>
        <p class="answer">Went blank for a second but took a risk. Mentioned the **United Nations Country Team (UNCT)**, which operates in member nations. Suggested deploying assistance through neighboring countries to conduct rescue operations.</p>

        <h2>Career & Ambitions</h2>

        <p class="question">F: What is your ambition in life?</p>
        <p class="answer">Went blank again. Eventually said I want to contribute to an organization and become a significant decision-maker.</p>

        <p class="question">F: Which organization?</p>
        <p class="answer">Couldnâ€™t think clearlyâ€”said "wherever Iâ€™d be working."</p>

        <p class="question">F: You must have an organization in mind.</p>
        <p class="answer">BCG (Should have given a broader, more strategic answer instead).</p>

        <p class="question">F: Who is the head of BCG in India?</p>
        <p class="answer">Didnâ€™t know.</p>

        <p class="question">F: What is BCGâ€™s business model in India?</p>
        <p class="answer">Didnâ€™t know.</p>

        <p class="question">F: These are business-related questions. How do we know youâ€™re genuinely interested in learning business?</p>
        <p class="answer">Explained my eagerness to learn about the business world. Gave my "Why MBA" response.</p>

        <p class="question">F: Which other calls do you have?</p>
        <p class="answer">Told.</p>

        <h2>Reading & Literature Discussion</h2>

        <p class="question">N: What are your reading habits? Fiction or non-fiction?</p>
        <p class="answer">Prefer fiction over non-fiction.</p>

        <p class="question">N: Favorite book?</p>
        <p class="answer">Harry Potter! :D</p>

        <p class="question">N: Why do you like it? What lessons did you learn?</p>
        <p class="answer">Learned the importance of perseveranceâ€”only by standing strong in difficult times can one enjoy good times.</p>

        <p class="question">F: What is the key message from J.K. Rowlingâ€™s life?</p>
        <p class="answer">Mentioned how she never stopped writing even after finishing the **Harry Potter** series and continued to expand the magical universe. (Should have also mentioned how she persevered through multiple rejections before achieving success.)</p>

        <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
        <p class="question">N: Okay, Prachi, we are done. Thank you!</p>

        <h2>Verdict: <span style="color: green;">Converted! ðŸŽ‰</span></h2>
