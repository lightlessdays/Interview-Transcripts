        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> The role of e-commerce in customers prioritizing brand loyalty over pricing</p>
        <p><strong>Performance:</strong> 15-minute WAT followed by GD. The discussion was chaotic, with participants going off-topic. Spoke twice, attempting to discuss Amazon’s brand promotion strategies but was frequently cut off.</p>
