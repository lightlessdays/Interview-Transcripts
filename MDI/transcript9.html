        <h2>MDI Interview Transcript</h2>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Hi Naman, Can you please introduce yourself?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Gave the prepared answer.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Do you use apps like Zomato or Swiggy?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Yes.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Let's try to solve a case study. The CMO of Zomato wants to increase sales. You have all the data gathered through the app. Can you give 5 strategies to increase sales?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Took 1-2 minutes to structure my thoughts. Asked some preliminary questions:*</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>*Are we targeting any particular location? - Gurgaon*</li>
            <li>*Do we need to increase sales only for the food delivery segment or all? - Only food delivery*</li>
            <li>*Do we have any information on what data is tracked through Zomato about a customer?*</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Can you think about what type of data can be tracked in a food delivery app?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Number of food deliveries, their amount, and corresponding vendor details since the account setup of a particular customer.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: What are the 4 important factors you consider while launching an app?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Can you now tell 5 strategies to increase sales?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            *1. Identifying locations where sales are lower and increasing offline promotions in those areas.*<br>
            *2. Creating an AI model based on transaction data to identify accounts whose AOV (Average Order Value) may decline in the next 6 months and targeting those accounts.*<br>
            *3. Asking users about their health targets and showing personalized food options based on their preferences.*<br>
            *4. Using real-time discount offers to target customers who spend a significant time on the app without ordering.*<br>
            *5. Offering discounts to users with items in their cart but who haven't placed an order yet.*
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience Questions</h3>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Panelist 2 started asking questions. Can you explain the work you did at Amex?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Gave the prepared answer.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Can you tell factors that you consider while tracking marketing campaign performance? (Related to work experience)</p>
        <p class="answer">*There are two major factors that we consider:*<br>
            *1. Number of leads being sent in a campaign.*<br>
            *2. Conversion Rates for those leads.*<br>
            *(Interviewer didnâ€™t seem satisfied with this answer.)*
        </p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: These are not the factors. Can you think again and tell?</p>
        <p class="answer">*Told her some top-of-the-mind factors, and she seemed fine with it.*</p>

        <p class="question">Interviewer: Thank you, Naman. We can close the interview.</p>
